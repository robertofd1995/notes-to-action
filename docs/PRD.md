# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Smart Todo List - AI-Powered Task Conversion

**Document Version:** 1.0  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Smart Todo List is an intelligent task management application that converts unstructured notes (written or audio) into organized, actionable items. Instead of manually transcribing ideas, organizing them, and creating calendar entries, users can simply capture their thoughts and let AI handle the conversion into structured tasks with deadlines, priorities, descriptions, related items, and subtasks.

**Problem:** Users frequently capture ideas and notes across multiple platforms, leading to scattered information. Even when using a single repository, manual cleanup and conversion into actionable tasks is time-consuming and often left incomplete.

**Solution:** An AI-powered todo list that automatically processes notes and transforms them into well-organized, actionable items ready for execution.
