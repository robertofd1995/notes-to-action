# What is this?

This project is a smart-todo list, you send it written or audio notes and an AI will convert your notes into action items (including deadline, priority, description, related items, sub actions)

I often have ideas and while writting them down is always an option, but then notes are probably disperse and end up in multiple places, and if you are already using consistently one unique place, you still need to clean up the notes and convert them into actions that archivable, add it into the calendar, move it in case something else comes in the middle. Well you probably know the drill, is not that easy. And this website should help you with this

# How it works?

# How can I run it locally?
# both frontend and backend
`bin/start`

## frontend

# How can I deploy it?

# Why did I do this?
Main goal is to improve my skills with React, but also to see how fast can I setup a project now with AI (I do not want to use it with the React part but yes with the other parts that I already know well)

Second goal is to use posthog and learn to use their product, measuring activation, retention, Feature flgas and replay

Third goal, if people find this cool and start using it by themselves it would be awesome. And I think it can help others to learn about these technologies. Will try to keep the git history as clean as possible, so one can review how I progress with it and how you can structure it
