# What is this?

This project is a smart-todo list, you send it written or audio notes and an AI will convert your notes into action items (including deadline, priority, description, related items, sub actions)

I often have ideas and while writting them down is always an option, but then notes are probably disperse and end up in multiple places, and if you are already using consistently one unique place, you still need to clean up the notes and convert them into actions that archivable, add it into the calendar, move it in case something else comes in the middle. Well you probably know the drill, is not that easy. And this website should help you with this
